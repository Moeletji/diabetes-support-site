    <h2>About Diabetes</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>What is Diabetes?</h3>
      <p>Diabetes occurs when your blood glucose (blood sugar) is too high because your body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin effectively. Insulin helps glucose from food enter cells for energy; without enough insulin, glucose stays in your blood and high sugar levels can cause health problems.</p>
      <h3>Types of Diabetes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Type 1:</strong> The body makes very little or no insulin and it is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. About 10 % of people with diabetes have type 1.</li>
        <li><strong>Type 2:</strong> The body does not make enough insulin or doesn't respond properly to the insulin it makes. It usually affects middle‑aged or older adults but is increasingly seen in younger people due to obesity, inactivity and diet. About 90 % of people with diabetes have type 2.</li>

    <h2>Recognising Blood Sugar Highs and Lows</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycaemia)</h3>
      <p>Low blood sugar happens when your level drops below about 3.9 mmol/L. Causes include taking certain medicines, eating too few carbohydrates, skipping or delaying meals, taking too much insulin, being more active than usual, sickness, or drinking alcohol without food.</p>
      <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> sweating, dizziness, trembling, hunger, anxiety or irritability, palpitations, headache, confusion or nausea.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>What to do</summary>
        <p>If your blood sugar is low or you have symptoms, act immediately: consume 15–20 g of glucose or fast‑acting carbohydrates (e.g. a small carton of fruit juice, three glucose tablets, a glass of sugary drink, or a few jelly babies). Test your blood sugar again after 10–15 minutes and repeat if it is still low. Keep glucose snacks at home, work and in the car. Tell your family, friends and colleagues about the symptoms so they can help.</p>
      </details>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycaemia)</h3>
      <p>High blood sugar can occur if you miss a dose of insulin or medication, eat more or differently than planned, are less active, are under stress or are sick. Over time, diabetes can change and affect your blood sugar.</p>
      <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> tiredness, thirst, blurred vision, frequent urination, headache, weight loss, or recurring infections.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Prevention &amp; Action</summary>
        <p>Monitor your blood sugar regularly; follow your eating plan; stick to your prescribed insulin/medication schedule; exercise regularly; get good sleep and manage stress. If you experience frequent high readings, arrange to see your doctor or diabetes nurse.</p>

    <h2>Healthy Lifestyle</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Eat Well</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat a wide variety of healthy foods including whole grains, legumes, vegetables and fruits.</li>
        <li>Choose low‑fat or fat‑free dairy products and lean proteins such as poultry, fish and beans.</li>
        <li>Limit saturated and trans fats, salt and added sugars.</li>
        <li>Keep alcohol intake sensible.</li>
      </ul>
      <details>
        <summary>Healthy Food Examples</summary>
        <p>Good vegetables include broccoli, leafy greens, cauliflower, squash, onions and peppers. Whole‑grain carbohydrates such as wild rice, quinoa, oatmeal and barley break down slowly for better blood sugar control. Proteins like lean meat, chicken, fish and eggs digest slowly and cause only mild rises in blood sugar.</p>
      </details>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Stay Active</h3>
      <p>Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity five times per week. Exercise doesn’t have to be extreme — climbing stairs, going for a brisk walk, or playing with children are great ways to move more.</p>
      <p>Regular activity helps lower blood sugar, improves heart health, reduces blood pressure and cholesterol, burns calories, improves sleep, decreases stress and anxiety, improves mobility and mood.</p>

    <h2>Foot Care</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>High blood sugar can cause nerve damage that reduces feeling in your feet. Simple daily care can help prevent complications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash feet daily in warm water and dry well, especially between the toes.</li>
        <li>Inspect feet every day for cuts, sores, blisters, redness or calluses; use a mirror or ask someone to help.</li>
        <li>Moisturise your feet but avoid applying cream between your toes.</li>
        <li>Cut or file toenails; wear well‑fitting shoes and soft socks; never walk barefoot.</li>
        <li>Check inside shoes before wearing to ensure there are no sharp edges or objects.</li>
        <li>Have a comprehensive foot exam by your doctor at least once a year, or more often if you have foot problems.</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- Ryzodeg Section -->
  <section id="ryzodeg">
    <h2>Ryzodeg® Basics</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>What is Ryzodeg?</h3>
      <p>Ryzodeg® is a combination insulin that contains an ultra‑long‑acting insulin (insulin degludec) and a rapid‑acting insulin (insulin aspart). It helps your body control blood sugar throughout the day and after meals.</p>
      <p>It is prescribed to treat diabetes in adults and in children from the age of 2 years. In type 1 diabetes it should be used with short‑acting insulin at meals, and in type 2 diabetes it is used with oral antidiabetic medicines. Extra caution is needed in children aged 2–5 years because the risk of low blood sugar is higher.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Using Ryzodeg</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ryzodeg is injected under the skin using a pre‑filled FlexTouch® pen. Do not inject into a vein or muscle. Recommended injection sites are the abdomen, upper arms and the front of your thighs. Change the injection site every day to avoid skin problems.</li>
        <li>Check that the insulin is clear and colourless and that the pen is undamaged before injecting.</li>
        <li>Attach a new needle, prime the pen with 2 units to remove air bubbles, then select your prescribed dose. Insert the needle into your skin, press and hold the dose button until the counter returns to 0 and keep it under the skin for at least 6 seconds. Remove the needle and dispose of it safely.</li>
        <li>If you miss a dose, inject your next dose with the next main meal on the same day. Do not take a double dose.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Dosing &amp; Adjustments</h3>
      <p>Your doctor may adjust your dose based on your blood sugar readings, changes in exercise, diet or other medications. Keep a Ryzodeg diary to record your doses and blood sugar results. Never stop using Ryzodeg without speaking to your doctor.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <!-- Safety Section -->
  <section id="warnings">
    <h2>Safety &amp; Precautions</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>When Not to Use</h3>
      <p>Do not use Ryzodeg if you are allergic to insulin degludec, insulin aspart or any of its ingredients, or if you are pregnant. Always check with your doctor before increasing exercise, changing your diet or travelling across time zones because these can affect your blood sugar.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Hypoglycaemia &amp; Hyperglycaemia</h3>
      <p>Low blood sugar can occur if you drink alcohol, use too much insulin, exercise more than usual, eat too little or miss a meal. Warning signs include headache, slurred speech, fast heartbeat, cold sweat, pale skin, feeling sick, extreme hunger, tremor, tiredness, confusion, difficulty concentrating and temporary changes in vision. Treat it immediately by eating glucose tablets or a sugary snack, testing your blood sugar and resting.</p>
      <p>High blood sugar may happen if you eat more or exercise less than usual, drink alcohol, get an infection or fever, use less insulin or stop using insulin without advice. Symptoms include dry skin, sleepiness, dry mouth, fruity breath, frequent urination, thirst, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting. Seek medical help if these occur.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Serious Allergic Reactions</h3>
      <p>Stop using Ryzodeg and get emergency medical help if you experience swelling of your hands, feet, face, tongue, lips or throat causing difficulty swallowing or breathing, widespread rash, hives or fainting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Other Side Effects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hypoglycaemia is the most frequent side effect.</li>
        <li>Local injection‑site reactions such as pain, redness, hives, swelling or itching usually disappear after a few days.</li>
        <li>Swelling around your joints (water retention) may occur when starting treatment but is usually temporary.</li>
        <li>To avoid skin changes like lumps or shrinkage (lipodystrophy), rotate injection sites.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Storage</h3>
      <p>Store Ryzodeg pens in the refrigerator (2–8 °C) before first use and do not freeze. Once in use, you can carry the FlexTouch pen at room temperature (below 30 °C) for up to four weeks. Always keep the cap on to protect from light and discard any unused solution after four weeks. Keep out of reach of children and do not use the insulin if it contains particles.</p>

    <h2>Supporting Loved Ones</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>Supporting someone using insulin can make a big difference. Here are ways you can help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn the signs of low and high blood sugar and how to respond quickly. Keep fast‑acting glucose nearby and know where the glucagon kit is stored.</li>
        <li>Encourage healthy eating and share nutritious meals together. Help with grocery shopping and meal prep to ensure balanced options.</li>
        <li>Be active together — go for walks, take the stairs or enjoy fun physical activities.</li>
        <li>Help with daily foot checks and remind them to attend regular foot exams.</li>
        <li>Support stress management by creating a calming environment and encouraging good sleep habits.</li>
        <li>Encourage them to keep a diabetes diary and accompany them to medical appointments.</li>
        <li>Know when to seek medical help. If they pass out from low blood sugar, turn them on their side, call for medical assistance and never give food or drink. Learn how to administer glucagon if prescribed.</li>
